# The Big E
March 13th, 2009, 4:25 PM.

Casey, Brandy, Katy and Justin were in line to have their fortunes told. Luckily, it was a Tuesday, so all fortunes were 20% off.

Her name was Didi the fortune teller. She rubbed her magical orb and patted it a few times.

"It seems that all four of you..." she said.

"Including a fifth and a sixth friend..." she added, pausing between sentences.

"... will die by the end of this month," finished Didi.

Justin slammed the table with his fist.

"That's some bullshit fortune. Honestly, I don't know who you are, but how do you make any monetary gain giving bad fortunes?" Justin said, with a disappointed and frustrated tone.

Justin stormed off into the distance where the group soon followed.

"I don't believe a damn word that fortune teller says," said Casey.

"But please, don't be so upset over it," she added.

"Wait, didn't she say that we would die next month?" Brandy gulped and swallowed his words anxiously.

"But like, only 70% of fortunes are true," replied Katy.

"Let's go grab some food at Micky Dee's," Casey interrupted.

"But, I hate McDonald's!" whined Brandy.

"Too bad, the rest of the group decided it was a good decision," replied Casey, with an annoyed tone.

The group headed to a nearby McDonald's just down town.

~~

"I want uhhh... Shit, what did you guys want again?" asked Casey.

"I want a quarter pounder with large fries and a Mountain Dew," said Brandy.

"I just want a McChicken, that's all," said Katy.

"Can I order breakfast or something?" said Justin.

"I don't think they do that. Atleast, not yet," Katy replied.

"Well, let me get just a medium cup of Coca-Cola," Justin replied.

"Are you sure you don't want anything to eat?" asked Katy.

"Nah, I had dinner before I came over to the Big E," replied Justin.

They recieved their food and sat down.

"So what have you been up to lately?" Justin asked Brandy.

"Just had to finish 4 days worth of homework because I was sick with the flu," Brandy replied.

"Really? I didn't even know you was gone," said Justin.

"I don't blame you. I don't talk much in school. That's mainly because I don't wanna get in trouble for talking and whatnot," said Brandon.

"Oh, cool, I guess," said Justin.

The group finished their food and headed home.

~~

On the way home, Justin got a text from a number he didn't recognize that read as follows:

`WE ARE ESC DESTINY. THAT FORTUNE THAT WAS TOLD IS REAL... ALL SIX OF YOU HAVE UNPRECEDENTED POWER THAT MUST BE ELIMINATED AT ALL COSTS.`

"What the hell is ESC Destiny?!?!?!?" muttered Justin.

The others didn't hear him.

"Must be some weird cult thingy," Justin said out loud.

"What?" the rest said in unison.

"Oh, nothing." Justin said, nervously.

Justin lied. He usually never tell lies, but this is an exception.

Each went to their homes.

Justin went to the bathroom, but then suddenly noticed a figure behind him in the mirror. It was tall, dark, and handsome. His hands were glowing, but he didn't notice.

"WHO THE HELL IS THAT?!" yelled Justin.

"I am your guardian. I watch over you and control your abilities. Your ability is to control time. That is why your hands are glowing," said the figure. 

"Wait, WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?" screamed Justin.

"Do not be alarmed, I am here to protect and guide you. The ESC Destiny thing you saw on your phone was a warning. Apparently a group is pursuing you and your friends, doing whatever they can to get you and your friends killed. I must not allow that to happen. My name is Lofi," said Lofi.

"You mean, I'm in danger? Sorry, WE'RE in danger?" asked Justin.

"Yes, and there's no doubt that your other friends have the same kind of ability as well," answered Lofi.

He went to sleep, dreaming that people were out to get him. He dreamt that two people cornered him down in an alley in order to take his life away.

Brandy, Katy, Casey all had a similar dream.

~~

It was 7:30 AM and it was time to go to school. All four got on bus 28 to go to school. Justin had math for first period, while the rest had PE.

"Damn, I hate school," Justin muttered.

"Wait 'till you go to college," Emma, the girl sitting next to Justin, giggled.

"The hell you know anything about college?" Justin asked.

Emma was silent.

"That's right, you don't know jack SHIT!" yelled Justin

"Knock off that hollerin' will you?" bus driver David said.

All arrived at Springfield Highschool.

What happened would be a chain of events that neither of Justin's friends would ever forget, a chain of events that would change their lives.

~~ END OF THE BIG E \~\~

## Lofi, stop!
The day played out normal until lunchtime. Justin's usual bullies were standing next to the cafeteria door.

Justin saw this as an opportunity to take action, so he shoved one of his bullies. This triggered his ability, causing him to pause time for one minute. He realized his amazing power was a force to be reckoned with. His ability allowed him to stop time, of course with an added limit of 60 seconds and 30 minute cooldown.

"Now I know what to do," Justin confidently said.

"If this works how I think it does," Justin continued.

Justin began to throw many punches in a single moment at the bully within frozen time. Time was frozen, so the bully didn't move.

After Justin resumed time by snapping his fingers, the bully went flying into the wall.

Nobody except Justin knew what was going on.

A crowd gathered up at the spot the bully had landed.

"What's going on over there?" one of the lunch ladies said.

The crowd was in shock, scratching their heads, as to no idea of what happened.

"The last thing that I remember is that two-face jerkwad Justin Kyles pushed me," the bully told the lunch lady.

Soon after Katy walked up to him.

"The principal wants you. I don't know what you did, but it sure as hell doesn't sound good," said Katy.

At the principal's office, Justin had an idea. What if he stopped time to erase the video footage?

He tried this idea for himself, but quickly realised that electronics won't work in frozen time.

Nobody would ever know that he had touched the computer.

Time resumed as normal.

Principal Williams turned around to his computer, and realized that his mouse and keyboard had moved a little.

"Wha..." Mr. Williams said in confusion.

"Anyways," Mr. Williams continued.

"Did you or did you not push Tyler Adams?" Mr. Williams.

Justin thought to himself how all principals take action to the bullied and not the bully themselves.

"I have zero idea what happened. I was just standing there," Justin nervously said.

"How about we check the footage that's on tape here," Mr. Williams said.

He inserted a rather large looking cassette tape labled "3/14/09 CAFETERIA CAM 4."

What was strange is that the footage started at 1:00 AM. Justin assumed that this is to keep an eye out for people that break into the school to steal stuff.

Mr. Williams fast forwarded the tape to about 12:25 PM.

"Here you are standing next to Tyler," he said.

The principal looked at the monitor in shock to see that Justin had seemingly instantaneously moved to another location.

"The darn camera must have cut out," he continued.

But then he took a look at the time on the footage. It was the same down to the millisecond.

"What in the world is going on? I didn't see the time change, so what just happened?" he said, shocked.

"Uhhh... Well, I dunno if you'd believe me or anything but..." Justin paused.

"It seems that I have these powers to control time," Justin said, worried he'll get into even more trouble.

"Don't play dumb with me. I know you messed with this computer when I wasn't looking," said the principal.

"I'm being serious!" Justin exclaimed.

Justin's phone buzzed with a message. It read as follows:

`Don't reveal your powers to anyone else... ~Team ElusiveFate`

Justin scratched his head for a moment.

Another message buzzed in.

`We will guide you to an elusive fate. One that you will never regret. ~Team ElusiveFate`

"What in the..." Justin said, under his breath.

Justin then rushed to the door.

The door was locked.

"Hey, where do you think you're going? You're gonna sit right here and explain what happened to me," the principal said.

Justin sat back down in the chair.

"Well, one day I was fine and the next, some weird ass figure started to talk to me through the mirror," Justin explained.

The principal lowered his glasses.

"There was a what, now?" said Mr. Williams.

Silence swept among them for a solid one minute.

"I have this ability, let me demonstrate," explained Justin.

Justin attempted to stop time by pushing the air but to no avail.

"I swear it worked earlier," Justin whined, repeatedly pushing the air with his hands.

This was because of the 30 minute cooldown, as mention earlier.

"Mmhm?" the principal said with his arms crossed.

"Looks like you're going to be suspended for the rest of the week, young man," the principal said, pointing at Justin.

Mr. Williams had thought to himself that it was definitely Justin who pushed Tyler, but he had no solid proof.

~~

The rest of the group at PE were playing dodgeball.

Brandy had hit Katy in the face with a dodgeball.

By then all of them had forgotten their dreams, except for Katy.

"I had this weird dream last night. This blue figure told me that I'm in danger or something... Something about an beam exclusive late? Something along those lines," Katy told Brandy.

"Now that you mention it, I had a similar dream, with the same mention of that... thingy you said," Brandy said, confused.

The two were in shock.

Casey walked up to them.

"Hey, what are you guys talking about?" asked Casey.

"Just a weird dream we had, that's all," said Katy.

Katy remembered something in her dream.

"I remember something now. I remember that there were 2 other people with us including you guys and Justin. Those 2 people were people I never seen in my life," said Kate.

"Weird, that was the same in my dream," said Brandy.

All of them had the same dream.

What they didn't know was there were 2 other people who had the same dream. They were just as confused as they were.

It seemed as though as if they were bound to fate.


Katy's ability: Manipulate states of solids, liquids, and gasses.

Brandon's ability: Can mold any object into any shape like clay.

Casey's ability: Manipulation of any electronics, including mechanical objects like pencil sharpeners, hard drives, among other stuff.
